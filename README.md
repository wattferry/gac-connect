An unofficial async Python client for **GAC / Aion international** connected-car
accounts — read your vehicle's status and control charging from your own code.

Confirmed against **Australia and New Zealand**. Every other country the service
supports is in the region table too, listed but not yet tested — see
[Regions](#regions). Reports welcome.

## Install

```bash
pip install gac-connect          # library
pip install "gac-connect[cli]"   # + the `gac` command
```

## Library

```python
import aiohttp
from gac_connect import GacClient  # noqa

async def main():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as http:
        client = GacClient("AU", http)

        # First run: sign in. You solve a slide puzzle and enter an SMS code.
        captcha = await client.start_captcha()
        # ... show captcha.background / captcha.piece, get the slide offset x ...
        await client.request_sms("04xxxxxxxx", x)
        await client.login_sms("04xxxxxxxx", "123456")

        vehicles = await client.list_vehicles()
        status = await client.get_status(vehicles[0].vin)
        print(status.soc, status.range_km, status.odometer_km)

        await client.charge_pause(vehicles[0].vin)
```

Pass a `TokenStore` to persist the session (the refresh token is single-use and
rotates on every refresh, so persistence matters):

```python
from gac_connect.session import FileStore
client = GacClient("AU", http, FileStore("~/.config/gac-connect/session.json"))
await client.load()
```

## CLI

```bash
gac login --mobile 04xxxxxxxx     # opens a browser puzzle, then asks for the SMS code
gac vehicles
gac status <VIN>
gac charge <VIN> pause            # or: now
```

## What you can read

State of charge, range, odometer, charging state and mode, plugged-in, cabin
temperature, 12 V battery, GPS, doors / windows / boot / lock state, per-tyre
pressure (in kPa) and temperature, and, where fitted, the fridge's mode, target
temperature and keep-running setting (`status.fridge_mode`, `status.fridge_temp_c`,
`status.fridge_keep_mode`, `status.fridge_keep_minutes`).

## Fridge

On cars with a fridge / warmer box:

```python
await client.fridge_on(vin, mode="refrigerate", temperature=3)   # 0 to 20 °C
await client.fridge_on(vin, mode="heat", temperature=42)         # 35 to 50 °C
await client.fridge_on(vin, mode="freeze", temperature=-12)      # -15 to -1 °C
await client.fridge_off(vin)
```

Each temperature is checked against the mode's range, then rounded to a whole
degree; bad values raise `ValueError` before anything is sent. Without a
temperature, this library's default for the mode is sent (refrigerate 3, heat 42,
freeze -12 °C), which also resets the target if the fridge is already running.
Calling `fridge_on` while the fridge runs changes its mode or temperature.

An accepted request is not proof the car applied it; check `status.fridge_mode`.

How long the fridge keeps running after you leave the car is a setting in the car.
`status.fridge_keep_mode` reports it as `"timed"` or `"unlimited"`. For a timed
setting, `status.fridge_keep_minutes` reports the remaining minutes supplied by the
service, which count down once you leave the car, or `None` when unavailable or
invalid. It is always `None` for unlimited or unknown settings.

## Command results

Commands are accepted asynchronously and their results are delivered by the
service over a separate channel. `PushClient` keeps that channel open and hands
each result (outcome, command event, session id) to your handler:

```python
from gac_connect import PushClient

def on_result(topic, payload, result):
    print(result.event, result.ok, result.session_id)

# The service's broker may be plain TCP; its credentials are short-lived, but
# you must opt in to sending them unencrypted.
push = PushClient(client.mqtt_info, on_result, decrypt=client.decrypt_push, allow_plaintext=True)
task = asyncio.create_task(push.run())   # reconnects on its own until stop()
...
push.stop()
await task
```

## Regions

`GacClient(region, ...)` takes an ISO country code. The table in
`gac_connect.const.REGIONS` covers all 56 countries the service is configured
for, with the two hosts, calling code and time zone each one uses:

```python
from gac_connect.const import CONFIRMED_REGIONS, LISTED_REGIONS, REGIONS

REGIONS["IL"]        # {'main': 'nl-app-api...', 'iov': 'eu-iov-sdk-access...', 'tel': '+972', ...}
sorted(LISTED_REGIONS)     # the 21 the app offers in its own country picker
sorted(CONFIRMED_REGIONS)  # the ones this library has actually signed in to
```

Three tiers, narrowest first:

- **Confirmed** (`AU`, `NZ`) — signed in and driven a car with.
- **Listed** — the app's own country picker offers them, so accounts exist:
  `AE AU BR ES FI GR HK ID IL KH KW MO MX NZ PH PL PT RU SA SG TH`. `IL` has a
  second-hand report of working; it stays out of the confirmed set until someone
  says so first-hand.
- **The rest** — wired into the build ahead of sale. The hosts are right; whether
  there is an account behind them is another matter.

Nothing in the protocol is region-specific — same keys, same signing, same
endpoints — so a region is only ever the four values above. If one does not work,
it is worth a report.

The table carries one time zone per country, which is a guess wherever a country
spans several (RU, BR, MX, ID, AU, ES, PT, CL). Charge windows are set in local
clock time, so give the car's own zone when the default is not it:

```python
client = GacClient("RU", http, timezone="Asia/Vladivostok")   # gac charge ... --timezone
```

## Sharing a session

The IoV refresh token is **single-use**: each refresh mints a replacement and
retires the one it was given. A session is therefore a chain, and only one holder
can advance it. Two things working through the same saved session will spend each
other's tokens, and whichever refreshes second is told its token was already used
and has to sign in again.

So give each client its own sign-in. Two Home Assistant entries pointed at one
stored session, the CLI sharing a session file with Home Assistant, or a session
copied between machines will all fail this way, intermittently and confusingly.
The same applies if a rotation is not saved: `TokenStore.save` is called on every
rotation and must durably persist before the next request, which is why the
default `MemoryStore` is only suitable for a single short-lived process.

### Running alongside the official app

Signing in here signs the phone app out, once. Sign the app back in and both keep
working.

Signing in mints two things: an account session on the main API and a vehicle
session on the IoV gateway. The account is allowed one current account session,
so a sign-in anywhere replaces the last one — that is what logs the phone app out
when this library signs in, and the app does the same to this library when it
signs back in.

A vehicle session is ended along with the account token that minted it, unless
that token has since been refreshed. So straight after minting the vehicle
session, sign-in refreshes the account token once, as the app itself routinely
does. From then on the phone app signing in cannot reach this library's vehicle
session, which refreshes itself for as long as it is used.

Versions before 0.3.0b1 skipped that step, so a session they minted was ended by
the next app sign-in — in Home Assistant, a re-authentication followed by signing
back in on the phone signed the integration out again. Re-authenticate once on
0.3.0b1 or later to replace such a session.

## Charging control

`charge_now`, `charge_pause`, and `set_charge_window` gate charging through the
car's schedule. The car applies commands asynchronously: pausing usually takes
effect quickly, resuming can take several minutes and may be delayed or fail — so
pause only for sustained periods.

## Request limits

Every request the library sends passes one limiter shared by all clients in the
process (`gac_connect.DEFAULT_LIMITER`); a client given its own `Limiter` is held
to both, so creating clients never resets the limits. Requests go out one at a
time, even across threads, at least a second apart, and no more than 20 a minute,
240 an hour and 3000 a day (`const.REQUEST_BUDGETS`, rolling windows, each
request counted when it finishes). Vehicle commands also have their own budget of
6 a minute and 60 an hour (`const.COMMAND_BUDGETS`). If the service answers "too
many requests", nothing is sent for at least 60 seconds, or for its `Retry-After`
(seconds or a date) up to a day. Past any of these the client raises
`RateLimitedError` (with `retry_after` in seconds) without sending anything.

The shared limiter keeps its state in a small file, locked while each request
runs, so every program and every run on the machine shares one budget and one
pause: a script restarted in a loop is limited like one that keeps running. The
file lives in your cache folder (`~/.cache/gac-connect/limits.json` on Linux,
`~/Library/Caches/gac-connect/` on macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\gac-connect\` on
Windows) or wherever `GAC_CONNECT_LIMITS` points. If it cannot be read or written,
nothing is sent. If it is corrupt, a copy is kept (`limits.corrupt`) and requests
pause for a day, since any pause recorded in it is unknown; delete the file to reset
it sooner. A host that stores the state itself can set
`DEFAULT_LIMITER.state_path = None` before its first request and use
`export_state()` / `import_state()` instead (the Home Assistant integration does).

What is counted: requests this library sends on one machine. Other machines, the
official app, and the push channel's broker connection are not counted. A poll
every few minutes is plenty for most uses.

## Notes and limits

- Sign-in needs a human: a slide puzzle and an SMS code. There is no headless login.
- Locking is available; unlock, remote power and charger-release need a
  remote-control PIN that this client does not yet support, so those commands
  are refused.
- Using the official app and this client on the same account at the same time can
  occasionally sign one of them out.

## Home Assistant

A Home Assistant integration built on this library is available separately.

## Changes

- **0.3.0b1** — two headline changes over the 0.2 line. **Signing in on the phone
  app and Home Assistant no longer sign each other out:** after minting the vehicle
  session, sign-in refreshes the account token once (as the app does), so a later
  app sign-in can no longer end the session — in Home Assistant, re-authenticating
  and then signing back in on the phone no longer signs the integration out.
  Signing in here still signs the app out once, and a session from an earlier
  version needs one re-authentication to benefit. **All 56 regions** the app is
  configured for are supported (see the b11 note below), with Israel (`IL`)
  reported working. Also: `FileStore` expands `~`.

- **0.2.0b11** — all 56 regions the service supports: `IL` (Israel) among them,
  plus `LISTED_REGIONS`
  and `CONFIRMED_REGIONS` to say how far each one has been checked. Fixes the IoV
  gateway for the Singapore and Middle East regions, which pointed at the EU one.
  `GacClient(..., timezone=...)` (and `gac charge --timezone`) overrides the
  region's default zone for countries that span several.

- **0.2.0b10** — Greece (`GR`) added to the regions (best-effort; shares the EU
  gateway). Thanks to @panosru.

- **0.2.0b9** — request limits: one `Limiter` shared by every client in a process
  (and kept between CLI runs), sending one request at a time with rolling budgets
  per minute, hour and day, a separate command budget, and a pause after any 429
  answer (Retry-After as seconds or a date, up to a day); requests over a limit
  raise `RateLimitedError` without being sent. The shared limiter's state is kept
  in a file in the user's cache folder, so separate runs share it; a client's own
  limiter applies on top of it. Limiter state can be exported and restored. Redirects are
  not followed. Token refreshes are coordinated between clients, rotated tokens are
  saved before use, and a session that can no longer refresh is not retried until
  a new session is stored.

- **0.2.0b8** — the fridge's keep-running setting in the vehicle status:
  `fridge_keep_mode` (timed or unlimited) and `fridge_keep_minutes` (time left).

- **0.2.0b7** — fridge / warmer box: `fridge_on(mode, temperature)` and
  `fridge_off()`, with per-mode temperature ranges checked before sending, and
  the fridge's mode and target temperature in the vehicle status.
